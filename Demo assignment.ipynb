    "Web development relies on a variety of core technologies to create dynamic and interactive websites and web \n",

    "\n",
    "HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content \n",
    "of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used to style the appearance of HTML elements, including layout, colors, \n",
    "fonts, and spacing, to create visually appealing web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. \n",
    "It is commonly used for tasks such as form validation, animations, DOM manipulation, and handling user\n",
    "interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a web server and a web \n",
    "browser. It defines how requests and responses should be formatted and transmitted over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Server-side Scripting Languages: Server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, and Node.js are used to \n",
    "create dynamic web content and handle server-side logic, such as processing form submissions, interacting with \n",
    "databases, and generating dynamic web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database Management Systems (DBMS): DBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite are used to store and \n",
    "manage data for web applications. They allow developers to create, read, update, and delete data from databases \n",
    "using SQL (Structured Query Language) or NoSQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Servers: Web servers like Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS are responsible for serving web content to \n",
    "users' browsers in response to HTTP requests. They handle requests, process server-side scripts, and deliver HTML,\n",
    "CSS, JavaScript, and other files to the client.\n",

    "#4. What is CSS and what is its purpose\n",
    "CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and\n",
    "formatting of HTML or XML documents, including the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. Its primary purpose is \n",
    "to separate the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing web developers to control the visual \n",
    "appearance of their web pages more efficiently and consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key aspects of CSS and its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Styling HTML Elements: CSS allows developers to apply styles to HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, \n",
    "links, images, and forms. Styles can include properties like colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and\n",
    "backgrounds, which determine how the elements are displayed on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layout and Positioning: CSS provides mechanisms for controlling the layout and positioning of elements on a web \n",
    "page. Developers can use techniques like floats, flexbox, and grid layout to create complex page layouts with \n",
    "multiple columns, responsive design for different screen sizes, and precise positioning of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsive Design: With the proliferation of devices with various screen sizes and resolutions, responsive design \n",
    "has become crucial in web development. CSS offers features like media queries, viewport units, and responsive grids\n",
    "to create websites that adapt and look good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Maintenance: By separating style information from the content of a webpage, CSS makes it easier to \n",
    "maintain and update the visual appearance of a website. Changes to the styling can be made in a single CSS file,\n",
    "which then applies to all pages that reference it, rather than having to modify each HTML file individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Reusability: CSS promotes consistency in design by allowing developers to define styles once \n",
    "and apply them across multiple elements or pages. Styles can be organized into classes and reused throughout the \n",
    "site, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility: CSS can enhance the accessibility of web pages by providing mechanisms for controlling the visual \n",
    "presentation while maintaining semantic HTML markup. This allows developers to create websites that are more \n",
    "accessible to users with disabilities, such as screen readers or users who rely on keyboard navigation."
